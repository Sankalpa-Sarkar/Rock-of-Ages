# Rock-of-Ages
A 2-dimensional simulation based on destroying and random spawning of rocks, built on Unity and scripted in C#, this simulation is developed as part of a Coursera course conducted by University of Colorado.

The coding of the scripts in this project was done in C# language on the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE, aided by the Unity Scripting Reference as well as the Microsoft Azure .NET Coding  Reference.  The game is built on the Unity 2D platform developed by Unity Technologies and employs sprites randomly generated by a randomized sequence from the centre of the screen. The essence of the game lies in the simulation of rocks on the screen given the constraint that not more than 3 rocks will be present on the screen at any time. If it exceeds 3 rocks, a destruction script destroys the rock particle and a random sprite is generated yet again.
